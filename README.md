# The Who, What and Where?

'The Iris Data Set' aka 'The Fishers Set' aka The Andersons Iris Data Set' was developed in 1936 by Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher (1890-1962). Sir Ronald Fisher was an English statistician and geneticist. He pioneered the application of statistical procedures to the design of scientific experiments(www.britannica.com/biography/Ronald-Aylmer-Fisher). This was most evident in Gaspé Peninsula, the evidence which led to the formulation of linear discriminant was collected. Linear discriminant is where on uses multiple measurements in taxonomic problems, resulting in classification of an organism into specific or named groups based on common or shared characters.

In the Fisher Iris Data set the organism was the Iris flower. Edgar Anderson was the sole individual who collected and recorded the data in the Gaspé Peninsula, using the same measuring equipment and measuring in the same unit (cm). Three species of Iris were identified and classified based on their sepal width and length and the petal width and length.

# Software required and used.

The code in this project was written and tested in Visual studio download link: https://www.visualstudio.com

Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment from Microsoft. It is used to develop computer programs, as well as web sites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. Visual Studio includes a code editor which supports IntelliSense (the code completion component) as well as code refactoring. The integrated debugger works both as a source and at machine-level. Initial release date Feb 2007 and the most recent update April 2018. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Studio

The anaconda program can be downloaded at the following link: https://anaconda.org

Anaconda is a free and open source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for data science and machine learning related applications. Package versions are managed by the package management system conda, it is quite simple to install, run, and update complex data science and machine learning software libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and SciPy. Anaconda Distribution is used by over 6 million users, and it includes more than 250 popular data science packages suitable for Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Release date for Anaconda was 6th September 2012. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaconda_(Python_distribution)

Follow the links and on screen instructions to download the software.

iPython is an automatic function once both are installed correctly it is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, developed for the Python programming language. iPython provides the following features including Interactive shells, browser-based notebook with support for code, text, mathematical expressions, inline plots and other media. Support for interactive data visualization, and tools for parallel computing. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPython. This function was used in Visual Studio to write and check the outcome of code, the writer found this an advantage as it appeared to minimise the lines of code needed to produce a favourable outcome. There are a number of command history shortcuts which are also advantageous and found using an internet search engine, the writer used Google.

# The Nuts and Bolts or the Petals and Sepals! (Investigations).

The data Iris set was imported form the directory root (iris.csv, which had been saved to the computer) in order to conduct some investigations on the numerical data.The data set is depicted by columns of numbers and each line ended with text identifying the iris species e.g.  6.4     2.8     5.6     2.1     Iris-virginica.From there the data table was separated to make it more aesthetically pleasing and easier to identify individual string. 

The writer felt that the following investigations based on evolving knowledge would be sought:

1.Average/mean of Sepal length.

2.Average/mean of Sepal width.

3.Average/mean of Petal length.

4.Average/mean of Petal width.

5.Minimum Sepal length.

6.Minimum Sepal width.

7.Minimum Petal length.

8.Minimum Petal width.

9.Maximum Sepal length.

10.Maximum Sepal width.

11.Maximum Petal length.

12.Maximum Petal width.

Once code was written for the above and results crosschecked from other online sources, the writer proceeded to write code to depict sepal widths and lengths for the various species, in pictorial form, mainly in the guise of a bar chart using matplotlib.pyplot which is (module matplotlib) an object-oriented plotting library, which may be imported directly, e.g.:import matplotlib.pyplot as plt.

# Personal Findings.

As the writer has had no previous coding skills, every day was a learning day. The analogy of learning to drive a car had been mentioned, well the engine has been started and slowly accelerated down the road. It appears also from many searches most individuals learn to drive with the data iris set, over a number of coding languages, and for this I am thankful.
