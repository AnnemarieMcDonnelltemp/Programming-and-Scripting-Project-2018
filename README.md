The Fisher Iris Data Set.

# The Who, What and Where?

'The Iris Data Set' aka 'The Fishers Set' aka The Andersons Iris Data Set' was developed in 1936 by Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher (1890-1962). Sir Ronald Fisher was an English statistician and geneticist. He pioneered the application of statistical procedures to the design of scientific experiments. This was most evident in Gaspé Peninsula, the evidence which led to the formulation of linear discriminant was collected. Linear discriminant is where on uses multiple measurements in taxonomic problems, resulting in classification of an organism into specific or named groups based on common or shared characters.

In the Fisher Iris Data set the organism was the Iris flower. Edgar Anderson was the sole individual who collected and recorded the data in the Gaspé Peninsula, using the same measuring equipment and measuring in the same unit (cm). Three species of Iris were identified and classified based on their sepal width and length and the petal width and length.

# Software required.

The code in this project was written and tested in Visual studio download link: https://www.visualstudio.com

Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment from Microsoft. It is used to develop computer programs, as well as web sites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. Visual Studio includes a code editor which supports IntelliSense (the code completion component) as well as code refactoring. The integrated debugger works both as a source and at machine-level. Initial release date Feb 2007 and the most recent update April 2018. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Studio

The anaconda program can be downloaded at the following link: https://anaconda.org

Anaconda is a free and open source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for data science and machine learning related applications. Package versions are managed by the package management system conda, it is quite simple to install, run, and update complex data science and machine learning software libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and SciPy. Anaconda Distribution is used by over 6 million users, and it includes more than 250 popular data science packages suitable for Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Release date for Anaconda was 6th September 2012. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaconda_(Python_distribution)
